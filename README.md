- **Localized Water Conservation Tips (If we want to introduce complexity to the app)**: introduce localized water saving tips depending on the geographic location and local water issues (ex.: user do alentejo recebe informações acerca da escassez de água na regiao ao contrario de user em regiao que nao seja de zona de seca (?))
